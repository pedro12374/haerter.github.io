I'm Pedro Haerter, a PhD Candidate in Physics at the Federal University of Paraná (UFPR), specializing in **Plasma Physics** and **Nonlinear Dynamics**. My current research primarily focuses on **transport and chaos in plasmas using non-autonomous Hamiltonian models**, with a particular emphasis on drift wave models. I am investigating the connection between drift wave amplitudes (generated by the Hasegawa-Mima equation) and Hamiltonian models of particle drift to study the system's transport properties.
 
I also work extensively with **particle escape in Hamiltonian systems**, particularly in plasma and advection equations that exhibit the non-twist condition. This condition leads to shearless barriers, significantly altering transport properties. My analysis of these escape phenomena primarily utilizes the basin entropy quantifier to understand the effects of various perturbations on escape basins, and how escape can be defined or optimized. I also explore the presence of Wada or highly fractal basins in these systems.

My previous work includes research on the synchronization of Kuramoto oscillators in a chemical medium. For this, I developed a code to solve an integro-differential nonlinear coupled equation and analyzed the diverse physical effects present within the system.

I am an active member of the Plasma Physics and Non-Linear Dynamics Group at UFPR since 2020. During my PhD, I spent a year as a visiting researcher at Universidad Rey Juan Carlos in Spain under the supervision of Professor Miguel A. F. Sanjuán, where I integrated into his research group and developed new research utilizing their expertise, particularly in the field of basins of attraction.

I am currently interested in continuing my study of dynamical systems derived from plasma applications, focusing on parameter drift and incorporating dissipation into these systems.
