The interplay between drift-wave coherence and particle transport in plasmas is investigated through a truncated Hasegawaâ€“Mima model coupled with a drift-wave Hamiltonian model. By reducing the system to a three-wave interaction, we identify regimes of periodic and chaotic wave amplitudes and link them to the emergence or suppression of zonal flows. Numerical simulations reveal two distinct transport regimes: hyperballistic motion under periodic waves, where coherent zonal flows channel particles poloidally, and superdiffusive spreading under chaotic waves, where non-periodic fields disrupt directional coherence. Particle tracking indicates that periodic waves enhance radial confinement while enabling rapid poloidal transport, whereas chaotic fluctuations suppress large-scale migration through chaotic scattering. These results highlight the critical role of wave-field coherence in determining transport efficiency and offer a conceptual framework for turbulence control, highlighting that manipulating the coherence of the turbulent field, in addition to its amplitude, is a key strategy for controlling plasma transport. The findings connect reduced-order models with fully turbulent systems, offering insights into harnessing self-organized structures, such as zonal flows, for improved plasma confinement.
